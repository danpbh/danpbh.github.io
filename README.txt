I took a template page and edited it for my use.
I had very little exposure to html prior to this,
so creating it was a learning experience itself.
I found it surprisingly easy to understand and 
make changes. 


This website is arranged specifically to showcase 
some of the work I have done over my software
engineering years. I am happy to talk more
about any of the projects listed.
