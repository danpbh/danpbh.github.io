							<p>Ever since I got my first iPod touch in 2010, I have always held the desire to upload an app on the App Store.
                                I used to adore the simplistic games of the early mobile era. After receiving an education in Software Engineering
                                and Unity Development, I decided to start working on making a mobile game that speaks to the older generation of 
                                iOS Apps. The goal of Marble Approach is a simple, "Get from point A to point B", type game, similar to the style of 
                                the Super Monkey Ball games.

                            </p>
                            <span class="image fit"><img src="images/MBGame.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I want the game to look aesthetically beautiful, yet simple enough to not cloud the user's screen with unnecessary stimuli.
                                For this reason, I am considering having no UI during gameplay, except for when the game is paused. Currently, there is a 
                                Joystick which allows the player to move the ball on screen. A potential compromise would be reducing the opacity of the 
                                Joystick to a low level. 
                            </p>

                            <p>Modern mobile games often receive negative feedback based on an abundance of microtransactions or time limited gameplay.
                                For this reason, along with my personal ideals, I won't include any of the forementioned attributes in the game. I want 
                                the player to feel as though they are progressing through the game and making achievements through the pace of their choice. 
                            </p>

                            <p>The largest challenge I have to face while making this game is finding a middle ground between aesthetics and performance.
                                I want the game to look nice, but also run on any typical mobile device without slowdowns. I want the lighting of the environment 
                                on each platform to change based on the player's movement, drawing them into the game more.
                            </p>
