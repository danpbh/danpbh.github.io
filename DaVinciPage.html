							<h1 class="major">Da Vinci Docking Training Program</h1>
							
							<p>Covenant HealthCare hospital in Saginaw, MI operated surgeries using the Da Vinci Surgical System.
                                Their surgical staff presented the problem that docking sequence times were consistantly high, sometimes upwards of two hours. 
                                High setup times correlated with high costs and increased the risk for complications to occur. Covenant sought help from a team
                                of software designers to approach the problem.
                                
                            </p>
							<p>When my team and I arrived at the hospital, we were able to step inside the operating room for a visual the machine and surrounding area.
                            </p>
                            <span class="image fit"><img src="images/DaVinci.jpg" width="" height="1000" /></span>
                            <p> 
                                I realized the issue they faced was due largely by obstruction of view from the robot itself. There was little room to look around
                                the machine as it was positioning. I theorized installing a camera to the front for a better visual field. However, due to 
                                the system being owned by a separate company and leased to the hospital, it was unable to be modified. Several times, the director we 
                                spoke with mentioned the idea of a training program being helpful in training new OR staff. I suggested we create a program similar 
                                to their operating simulation, specifically for the docking sequence.
                            </p>

                            <p>After leaving from the hospital, I proposed the idea to create the program in Unity as I had knowledge of it prior. 
                                My team members had not been exposed to Unity but were willing to endeavor in the course of action. This presented the 
                                opportunity for me to step up as a leader and teach them the basics of how Unity works. I knew if I was in their position,
                                I would be starting a little out of my comfort zone and I wanted to close that gap for them to succeed in the project.
                            </p>

                            

                            <span class="image fit"><img src="images/DaVinciPic.jpg"  /></span>

                            <p> I designed a mockup in Blender and brought it to Unity for us to work with. Using C#, I scripted the 
                                transition between scenes and assigned movement for the user to move and interact with the robot. The 
                                objective was for the user to push the robot to a precise position next to the patient while their vision is 
                                accurately obstructed by the Da Vinci's body.</p>

							<P> Given more resources and time, I would improve this project by creating it in a VR environment. I believe people
								learn best when actually operating the task they are trying to learn, and an education program on a computer limits the 
								real life scenario. The closer the user feels to experiencing the real procedure, the better understanding they will have of it.
